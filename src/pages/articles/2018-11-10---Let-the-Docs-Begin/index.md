Big change to my personal site that I haven't touched in over a year. Hoping to use it as a public facing repository of notes, tidbits, and advice to myself and dangerously others. Looking forward to personalizing with a Google Photos API inteface to get some fun pictures of the kiddo making us sweat it out on the daily.
