I try to keep myself busy with endeavors that make me feel like I'm "time traveling". Learning new languages and patterns definitely make time fly. I strive to see others' perspectives while working together, and enjoy finding constructive thoughts and solutions surrounding fun and challenging problems.

I have a deep love for linguistic and metaphysic inquiry, which has led me into the realm of computation and programming. I'm an open door, so please connect with me and we can talk about programming, surf, language, ancient history and mythology, or even giant swirling meteorological monsters in the middle of the ocean.
