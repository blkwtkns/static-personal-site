Love those projects that make feel like I'm 'time traveling'. Enjoy learning new languages and patterns. I enjoy working seeing others' perspectives, and working together to find new thoughts and solutions surrounding fun and challenging problems.

I have a deep love for linguistic inquiry, which has led me into the realm of computation and programming, and also has me very interested in functional programming concepts. I'm an open guy, so connect with me and we can talk about programming, surf, language, ancient history and mythology, or even giant swirling meteorological monsters in the middle of the ocean.
